# ALU-Open_Source
This Repo contains details of designing and implementing a 8 bit ALU module using Open source ASIC/IC Design tools

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a functional 8-bit ALU using open-source tools for ASIC/IC design. The ALU will perform arithmetic and logical operations on 8-bit binary inputs.
